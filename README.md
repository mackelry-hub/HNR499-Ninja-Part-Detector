# HNR 499 – AI Motorcycle Part Identifier

This repository contains all code, notebooks, and documentation for my
Honors 499 project at GVSU: a progressive exploration of neural networks
(from high-level Keras models down to fully manual NumPy implementations)
and an applied YOLOv8 motorcycle part detection system.

## Structure

- `notebooks/mnist/` – Six MNIST experiments at decreasing levels of abstraction.
- `notebooks/yolo/` – YOLOv8 training and inference notebooks for Ninja 250 parts.
- `docs/` – Meeting notes, PDF exports of models, project outline, and (eventually) the final paper.
- `environment/` – `requirements.txt` and environment info for reproducibility.

## How to use

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mackelry-hub/HNR499-Ninja-Part-Detector.git
